- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunrivityCoding
- 👀 I’m interested in traveling, karate, art& crafting and coding. But I also read, play and watch and write about it. After all, writing is a big part of my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, C#, JavaScript and some frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular for the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me samy@sunrivity.com or on my blog (www.sunrivity.com) via contact form or social media (https://linktr.ee/sunrivity).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/ her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I pretty much taught myself most of the coding knowledge I have, even though I had a 4-years lasting education.
